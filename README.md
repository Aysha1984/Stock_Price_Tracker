This script is a Stock Price Tracker designed to fetch real-time stock market data using the Yahoo Finance API via the yfinance library. It enables users to monitor stock prices at regular intervals and save the data to a CSV file for analysis. The script prompts the user to input a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple), the desired output file name, and the interval in seconds between successive data fetches. It retrieves historical stock data for the last day at a 1-minute interval, leveraging the yfinance library for efficient data access.
